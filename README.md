# Monorepo with pnpm typescript
It is to solve my wondering about how to set up the monorepo using pnpm from scratch and how paths property on typescript's complier options work.

To solve two questions, I read two websites.
For monorepo setup, I read [monorepos-with-pnpm](https://levelup.video/tutorials/monorepos-with-pnpm/intro). for tsconfig, I read [Typescript-Module-절대경로-설정-방법](https://blog.spiralmoon.dev/entry/Typescript-Module-%EC%A0%88%EB%8C%80%EA%B2%BD%EB%A1%9C-%EC%84%A4%EC%A0%95-%EB%B0%A9%EB%B2%95)

What I felt after going through these struggles is that setting up monorepo is straight-forward. Once I understand, it works, but handling tsconfig.js is not easy to understand. I read so many articles and official docs, but I didn't understand what they said. I finally got it after I tested many various case to figure out how compiler options work.


I now make more sense about compiler options in tsconfig, but I still need time to overcome how to setup typescript.
